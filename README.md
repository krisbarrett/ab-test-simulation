# ab-test-simulation

This repository contains code for a multithreaded AB testing simulator written in C++. The simulation randomly assigns samples to either group A or group B, with each group having different conversion probabilities. The simulation can calculate both false positive and true positive rates.

## Requirements
The project requires the following dependencies to be installed on your system:

* `Bazel`: A fast, scalable, and multi-language build system.
* `C++14 or later`: This project uses modern C++ features, and you need to have a C++14 or later compatible compiler.

## Building

To build the project, navigate to the directory where the code is located and run:

```bash
bazel build main
```

## Testing

We have a number of tests to verify the correctness of the program. Run the tests with the following command:

```bash
bazel test //...
```

## Usage

After building, you can run the program using the binary generated by Bazel. This program will run a simulation and print both the false positive rate and the true positive rate for the given parameters.
